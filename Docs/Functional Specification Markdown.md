**Functional Specification**

**Background:**   
**TradeRewind** is a Python toolkit that allows users to:

1. **Define** their trading strategy (rules for when to buy/sell)  
2. **Backtest** the strategy on historical stock market data (2015-2024)  
3. **Analyze** performance with professional-grade metrics  
4. **Visualize** results with charts and reports  
5. **Compare** different strategies to find the best approach

**User profile (Identifying our users and user stories):**  
**Data Scientist**

* Madeline is trying to get a job as a data scientist. She is working towards building her portfolio and realizes that she has retail and sports projects, but not any financial ones.  
* To diversify her portfolio, she wants to build a platform that can help users with different investment options. Madeline is planning to build an interactive web-tool that users can play around with different trading strategies.   
* The user provides what kind of stock they want to analyze and the trading metric.   
* The web-tool will result in a visualization of how the stock has been doing over a given period of time. It will also give the risk analysis of using the stock and trading metric that was chosen.

**Finance Students**

* Bhavana is a finance graduate student learning quantitative trading strategies.  
* Bhavana wants to test if trading strategies (like moving averages) would have made money on different stocks over the past 5 years.  
* Bhavana wants to understand risk metrics (Sharpe ratio, drawdowns) and see which strategy performs best.  
* Bhavana needs to experiment safely with fake money before investing her real savings.  
* Bhavana has strong finance knowledge but limited coding skills and values a simple web interface where she can point-and-click to run backtests.

**Aspiring traders**

* Orly, who is an aspiring trader   
* Orly wants to use the software to decide how to invest $5,000 into KO by comparing three trading strategies using historical data from the past 10 years \- she wants to determine which strategy performs best.  
* Orly uses a graphical interface to select a stock, choose trading strategies, and review performance results generated by the platform.  
* Orly needs clear visualizations, easy to read metrics, and an easy way to identify the best-performing strategy.  
* Orly has limited technical knowledge and minimal experience with complex trading tools. She requires an intuitive, beginner-friendly interface with minimal configuration complexity.
