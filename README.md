### Data 515 Final Project - UW
#### Authors: Arlette Ngabonzima, Priyal Jain, Sophia Koehn

Project Type: Interactive Tool

Questions of Interest:
    1. Can traders test trading strategies without using real money?
    2. Can traders validate strategies using historical trends?
    3. Can traders identify bad trading strategies from bad timing?

Goal: TradeRewind is a Python toolkit that allows users to:

    - *Define* their trading strategy (rules for when to buy/sell)
    
    - *Backtest* the strategy on historical stock market data
    
    - *Analyze* performance with professional-grade metrics
    
    - *Visualize* results with charts and reports
    
    - *Compare* different strategies to find the best approach

    We aim to address these challenges and make financial decisions easier for all types of users.
