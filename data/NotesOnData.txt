it could be still be used but as informational table that we bring in for joining

Very relevant with numerous stocks to offer insight into a stock’s high, low, and traded volume
Very limited in times of time - its data for only 2 months (2025 - 02 -07 to 2025 - 05 -05)

This one is a little irrelevant for this project, it analyzes an individual's financial risk when it comes to being approved for a loan.
The dataset consists of 50 features related to personal and financial attributes of individuals
